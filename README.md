### Overview

The JoBins Dashboard is an interactive, responsive webpage built to closely mimic the provided Figma design. The web application includes a dynamic sidebar, a functional filter section, a table displaying user data with pagination, and responsive components. The project was developed using modern front-end technologies, including React, Sass, and Tailwind CSS, while paying close attention to design accuracy, responsiveness, and user experience.

### Features

Interactive Sidebar: The sidebar can be collapsed/expanded when clicked, and has hover effects on each item for better user experience.

Filter Section: A functional filter section with dropdowns and a search bar, where the search input logs user queries to the console.

Data Table: The table is rendered dynamically using data from a static API. It includes:

Pagination with smooth rendering of elements.
Dropdown to select the number of rows displayed per page (10, 25, 50).
Interactive "View Details" button for each table row.

Design Accuracy: All elements were carefully designed and implemented to match the Figma file, ensuring:

Exact colors used from the design file.
Accurate positioning, sizing, and alignment of components.
Proper spacing and padding between elements.

Responsiveness: The dashboard is fully responsive across different screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Animations: Subtle CSS animations  are applied while rendering components like the dashboard, providing a smooth user experience.

API Integration: The data table dynamically loads 50 entries via a static API simulation.

### Tech Stack
